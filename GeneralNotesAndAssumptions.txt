We will assume that a page can only belong to one category and that a category can have many pages
(if we want the same page to multiple categories then we need to make 2 instances of that page (not ideal))

Category Model:
field | type
name    charfield
views   integerfield
likes   integerfield

Page Model:
field | type
category ForeignKey
title   charfield
url     URLfield
views   integerfield
